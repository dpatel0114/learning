## Data Structure: 
First of all, lets learn about Singly Linked List: 
    ![Getting Started](images/singly_image.png)
    - Will help you to orgnize the data and store the data. 
    - A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. 
    - Linked Lists are incredibly useful programming data structures; they store both data and order information in a dynamic way. 
    - The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.
    - The end point into a linked list is called the tail of the list. 
    - There are some methos will help you to organize Singly Linked List:
    1. Push -> Takes value in. (adding node to end of the list)
    2. Pop (removing node from end of the list)
    3. Shift (removing node from beginning)
    4. Unshift -> Takes value in. (adding node to beginning)
    5. get (getting node from the list)
    6. set (setting node to something else)
